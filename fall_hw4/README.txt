In order to test the given codes please change the constants that is defined at the beginning of the tableTest.cpp which is the driver function of the homework.
In Makefile file I just compile the .cpp files and make test executable. Therefore in order to run the codes you can write ./test.
I also put the .txt files that I tried before in my report into the zip file.
